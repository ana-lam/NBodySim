## The N-Body Problem: An Exploration of Numerical Integration & Dynamics
**Ana Lam, 12/12/23 CompMeth Final Project**

The N-body problem involves predicting and understanding a dynamical system of many bodies under the influence of physical forces (e.g. gravity). For N > 2, analytical methods prove complicated though there exist solutions to special configurations of the 3 body problem and one could theoretically solve the power series (its convergence can be described as elusive). Therefore, numerical methods have proved powerful in understanding the behavior of N-body systems.
